# Overview

This project contains the infrastructure and server management scripts for my home lab.
The name of the project comes from a "plot" of land being similar to server infrastructure.

This project and its accompanying docs are for my own reference,
but they are published publicly in case others find some use from the project.

To use this project, the following build dependencies are required:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [JustFile](https://just.systems/)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
